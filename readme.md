# LeetCode Blind 75 & NeetCode Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the **Blind 75** problems from **LeetCode** and **NeetCode**. It is a challenge to solve the most essential algorithm problems that are commonly asked in technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

```

C:\Files\Projects\leetcode
├── blind75 (neetcode)
│   └── [Problem Solved Files]
└── readme.md

````

### `blind75 (neetcode)`:
- This folder will contain the **solutions** for the **Blind 75** problems from **NeetCode** and **LeetCode**. Each problem will be solved with detailed comments and explanations for the code.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- **Take the Blind 75 problem challenges** from **LeetCode** and **NeetCode**.
- **Solve** the problems here using Python and provide explanations for each solution.
- **Document** the solutions and help improve problem-solving skills.

## Current Focus:
- Blind 75 problems (from NeetCode and LeetCode).
- Solutions will focus on **optimal algorithm design** and **clean code**.

## Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x (or higher) installed.
- Install any dependencies (if any) using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Contribution

* Feel free to fork this repo and contribute solutions to other problems in the **Blind 75** series.
* If you want to contribute a solution, create a new Python file for each problem, and make sure to follow the solution format in the repo.

## Resources

* [NeetCode Blind 75 Problems](https://neetcode.io/practice/practice/blind75) - Official problem set
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) - Online judge and coding challenge platform

### **Explanation**:
1. **Project Overview**: The introduction section explains the repository’s purpose and what it's about.
2. **Repository Structure**: This section shows the current folder structure, which includes the `blind75 (neetcode)` directory where you'll be storing your solution files.
3. **Contribution**: Encourages others to contribute solutions to the Blind 75 problems.
4. **Resources**: Provides links to resources (like the NeetCode page and LeetCode platform) for the Blind 75 problem set.

### Next Steps:
- As you continue adding solutions, you can add a **new Python file** under the `blind75 (neetcode)` folder for each problem.
- As you solve each problem, you could include explanations, time/space complexities, and edge cases in comments within the solution files.
